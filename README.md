# Raza
A toy programming language used as a learning project. Implemented in Scala.

## Status

Lexer and parser are done, and it's reasonably easy to add new constructs. Both are
handwritten, and parsing uses simple recursive descent. The interpreter structure is all in
place and can interpret almost all basic constructs. 

### Done

* Variables
* Arithmetic
* Strings
* Functions 
* If statements and expressions

### TODO

* Loops
* Assignment (maybe)
* Some built-ins (math functions, string manipulation, ...)

## Future plans 

I would most likely want to implement either some Object-Oriented features (class- or
prototype-based) or a static type system. Planning far ahead isn't really gonna happen with
this project though as I'm mostly working on whatever feels interesting at the moment.
